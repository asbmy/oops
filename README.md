object oriented programming stuff

The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

1. Encapsulation, achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class.
2. Abstraction, object should only expose a high-level mechanism, the mechanism should be easy to use.
4. Inheritance, reuse the common logic and extract the unique logic into a separate class.
5. Polymorphism, many shapes, gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent with each child class keeps its own methods.
